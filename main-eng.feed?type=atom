&lt;p&gt;Recent British tragicomedy about suicide bombers, &quot;Four Lions,&quot; offers an unusual perspective on these issues.

Jihadists who, like the main character, leads usual &quot;Western&quot; lifestyle and shuns his too religious brother, who closes his wife in a small room, looking just like closet.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extremely hilarious (and with foul language) this tragicomedy, however, is unlikely to give you a pleasant mood. The authors managed not just to satirize semi-literate terrorists. In the last few minutes they, literally, gave an account of the current &quot;war on terror&quot; with its innocent victims, tortures and lying politicians.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; [The Ministry] recognized that protectionist policy on the meat market of Ukraine instead of the expected increase in production led to the shortage in the last few years.

&lt;br /&gt;...

&lt;br /&gt;The plan to overcome shortage in domestic market consisted of government protectionist policies, namely extension of subsidies to the industry and increasing of imports control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in fact, government policy in this area had an opposite outcome. Meat shortage on domestic market had grown, recognizes the ministry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a surprise! You can not cure shortage with an import prohibition. Additional production do not emerge that way. No reasonable person would argue that if government ban imports of Chinese and Taiwanese electronics, you can expect growth of electronics production in Ukraine. And it can not be changed with government subsidies. To fund morally outdated and backward technology of production is not a solution. Sure, the beneficiaries would be satisfied. But what about consumers prevented from buying imported goods and forced to pay subsidies to farmers with their tax money. Unfortunately, the bureaucratic brain can generate only one explanation for the failure of his kind of policy: there was not enough money for subsidies.&lt;/P&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minister of Agrarian Policy Mykola PRISYAZHNYUK believes that imports of fruits and vegetables that can be grown in Ukraine should be prohibited.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our officials still not able to think beyond protectionist categories. They can not get why people are buying non-Ukrainian products. So the dearest minister invents his own version of why average Ukrainian consumes imported goods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;In this situation our consumer becomes accustomed to imported products. This is the main problem with which we are faced.&quot;&lt;/Em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we, like addicts, can no longer refuse from consumption of imports. And when we come to the store first thing we look at is not the prices of goods, but what's the country of production.&lt;/P&gt;</summary>
